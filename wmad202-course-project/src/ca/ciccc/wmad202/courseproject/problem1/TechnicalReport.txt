■　OpenFileReader
In the getIntegerArray method in the OpenFileReader, the scanner is used to read castles.txt.
Then, it is stored in ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>.

In the InnerOpenFileReader method, the type of ArrayList is changed from ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>
to ArrayList<Integer>, and processing is done so that the value can be passed to CastleCompany Class.

■　CastleCompany
The main method in CastleCompany processes the values received from the OpenFileReader Class.
After declaring the int types begin, next, and end, the process of surveying the land is done.
We will divide the process into three parts: Up land, Down land, Straight land, and Peaks, hills, and flats.
